pure-linalg is an experimental linear algebra library for Pure.

its main objective is to provide a way of writing linear algebra 
equation in an intuitive way with the least sacrifice possible 
in terms of speed.

this is achieved by applying the powerful term rewriting capabilities
of Pure which make it simple to translate linear algebra equations 
into an optimized sequence of BLAS calls.

it is currently in a prototype status and is not intended for use
